Code style guide
****************

   - Use appropriate indentation, with 4 spaces per indentation level. (Tabs cause problems, as they render differently in different places or for different people).
   
   - Don't use excessively long lines, as this makes code hard to read. 80 characters is good, but not a hard limit.
   
   - Use blank lines in appropriate places to separate small sections of code. Don't add them in random places.
   
   - Use snake_case to name variables and functions. Use descriptive but concise names and avoid cryptic or non-standard abbreviations.
   
   - Use a single space around binary operators for clarity.
   
   - Commit messages should start with the ticket ID (e.g. HIP-280: Add coordinate and visibility phase rotation functions).
   
   - Branch names should start with the lower case ticket ID, have no spaces or underscores, and use hyphens to separate words (e.g. hip-280-phase-rotate).
